# The world of indestructible-ish glassware

I've lost count of how many glasses I've broken over the years. From accidentally knocking them off the table to fumbling while washing dishes. Recently, this got me wondering: are there any truly durable glassware options out there?

As it turns out, there's a fascinating history behind "unbreakable" glasses, and some modern options that might just save me from my clumsy ways, and reduce there impact on our planet.

## The Superfest story

Back in the 1980s, East Germany faced a glass shortage. Their solution? A product called Superfest. This wasn't your ordinary glassware – it was made using a special process that resulted in nearly indestructible drinking vessels.

Superfest glasses underwent a chemical treatment called ion exchange. Without getting too technical, this process essentially created a compressed outer layer on the glass, making it incredibly resistant to breaking. These glasses were a hit in East Germany, with around 120 million sold by 1990.

Interestingly, while Superfest was seen as a potential export star, it never really took off internationally. Some speculate that foreign companies weren't keen on the idea of glassware that rarely needed replacing – after all, broken glasses mean more sales.

## Modern Ion Exchange glassware

While Superfest itself is no more, the technology behind it lives on. Today, ion exchange is primarily used to create durable smartphone screens as it's the basis behind the famous Gorilla Glass. However, there are still a few companies making glassware using similar techniques:

1. [Aderia](https://www.ishizuka-glass.com/product/): This Japanese brand produces a range of durable glasses, including beer glasses and other drinkware.
2. [Nude](https://eu.nudeglass.com/collections/stem-zero): Their Stem Zero line offers beautiful, high-end wine glasses that are surprisingly tough. Fair warning though – they come with a pretty hefty price tag.

Learning about these modern alternatives got me thinking about the bigger picture of product longevity. It's frustrating to live in a world where so many things seem designed to break or become obsolete quickly. I wish more companies would focus on creating long-lasting products that are worth buying once, even if they cost more upfront.

While I probably won't be rushing out to buy a set of ultra-expensive unbreakable wine glasses just yet, I'm glad to know options exists and will keep an eye on it next time I break one. More importantly, learning about Superfest and modern durable glassware has reinforced my belief in the value of well-made, long-lasting products.

I hope more companies start prioritizing durability and longevity in their designs. In the meantime, I'll be a bit more careful with my current glasses – and maybe look into those Aderia beer glasses for my next purchase!
